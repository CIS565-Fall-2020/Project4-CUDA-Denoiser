consider using ping pong buffers for the blurred image


starting off with smaller cases
there may be a way to 

How does dim3 work? and dimensions in CUDA. Does dim3 set unspecified arguments to 1 or 0?
Does CUDA expect unused dimensions to be 1 or 0?



How do these checkCUDAError work? They sometimes say that an entire is occurring at an incorrect location if 
I dont have one at every CUDA function call.



Do we need to include new functions in header files?



Inside of CUDA files are we using c or C++

Dont have classes. The coding style might be closer to C instead of C++. You can pass structs to CUDA kernels.

When using the memory window is it showing you gpu or cpu memory when you copy and paste an address
from the locals or autos window?

Can memcpy from the device back to the host.
And start with a smaller sized buffer so that you can check the values in the buffers by hand.


dev_data1, dev_data2;
// cudamalloc, memcpy, etc
// for eah iteration, launch kernels on dev_data1 and dev_data2
int* temp = dev_data1
dev_dta1 = dev_data2
dev_data2 = temp


The weird alternating thing where every other value was zero was due to the book's funky way of ping ponging.
